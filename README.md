# Dengue-Predictive-Analysis

Dengue fever is an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas, and the understanding of its hematological changes is crucial for the improvement of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. 

Here I have tried conduct a detailed Dengue Prediction Analysis through statistical test on hematological parameters for the systematic record of patients suffering from dengue infection: age, sex, hemoglobin, WBC count, differential count, RBC panel, platelet count, and PDW. The dataset has in-depth records of patients admitted to Upazila Health Complex, Kalai, Jaipurhat, Bangladesh.
