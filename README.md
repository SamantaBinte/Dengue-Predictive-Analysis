# Dengue-Predictive-Analysis

Dengue fever is an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas, and understanding its hematological changes is crucial for improving diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. 

Here I have tried to conduct a detailed Dengue Prediction Analysis through statistical tests on hematological parameters for the systematic record of patients suffering from dengue infection: age, sex, hemoglobin, WBC count, differential count, RBC panel, platelet count, and PDW. The dataset has in-depth records of patients admitted to Upazila Health Complex, Kalai, Jaipurhat, Bangladesh.
